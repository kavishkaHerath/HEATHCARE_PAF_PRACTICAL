Important: DB file and Document file uploaded.

Since time and calendar have to be validated, it was used 'day' and 'time' as ‘type’. Hence this will work properly with 
a browser like chrome. But the calendar and time will not be validated in eclipse. So, for a proper output better run with 
a browser.
